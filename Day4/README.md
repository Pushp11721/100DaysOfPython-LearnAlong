# 📅 Day 4 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Lists: creating, accessing, updating, and extending
- Nested lists
- Importing standard and custom modules
- Randomization in Python using the `random` module
- Using `randint()` and `random()` for number generation
- Using `choice()` to select a random element from a list
- Mini-projects with randomness and user input

## 📂 Files Included
- `list.py`: Basic list operations like indexing, updating, `append()`, and `extend()`.
- `list2.py`: Example of **nested lists** with fruits and vegetables.
- `randomAndMods.py`: Using Python's `random` module and a custom module (`my_module.py`).
- `my_module.py`: A simple module defining a favorite number.
- `HeadTail.py`: Randomly outputs **Heads** or **Tails** using `randint()`.
- `exercise.py`: Randomly selects one person from a list to pay the bill using `randint()` and `choice()`.
- `Project_RockPaperScissors.py`: A complete **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** using ASCII art, lists, conditionals, and randomness.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 4, I:
- Learned how to work with **lists**, including updating items, and adding elements using `append()` and `extend()`.
- Explored how to **import modules**, including both Python's built-in modules and my own custom module.
- Practiced **random number generation** using `random.randint()` and `random.random()`.
- Built several mini-projects using randomness:
  - A coin toss simulator (`HeadTail.py`)
  - A bill-splitting assistant (`exercise.py`)
  - A fully interactive **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using visuals and logic.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Lists can hold multiple values and are extremely flexible.
- `append()` adds a single item, while `extend()` can add multiple items at once.
- `random.randint(a, b)` returns a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).
- `random.choice(list)` is a concise way to pick a random element.
- Custom modules can be created and imported just like Python’s built-in ones.
