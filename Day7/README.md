# 📅 Day 7 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Project-based learning: Building the classic **Hangman** game
- Random word selection using `random.choice()`
- Working with strings and list indexing
- Game state tracking using loops, conditions, and ASCII art
- Maintaining and updating player progress visually

## 📂 Files Included
- `Hangman.py`: Full Hangman game implementation using conditionals, loops, random module, and visual feedback.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 7, I:
- Created my first **mini-game** using Python — the classic **Hangman**.
- Learned how to manage **game state**, such as number of lives, user guesses, and correct letters.
- Used **ASCII art** to visually represent the hangman’s progress.
- Applied string manipulation and conditionals to reveal correct guesses and update the display after each round.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- `random.choice()` is great for picking a random element from a list (e.g., words).
- Game logic involves tracking multiple states: guessed letters, remaining lives, and win/loss conditions.
- Using `while` loops helps continuously run a game until a condition is met.
- Visual representation improves user experience even in simple text-based games.
