# 📅 Day 8 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Defining functions with and without parameters
- Passing multiple arguments to functions
- Difference between **positional** and **keyword** arguments
- Creating encryption and decryption logic using character shifts
- Implementing a Caesar cipher using custom functions and loops

## 📂 Files Included
- `funct.py`: Creating simple functions and passing one input argument.
- `funct2.py`: Demonstrating functions with **multiple arguments** and **keyword-based calling**.
- `encoder.py`: A Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder program that:
  - Encrypts or decrypts user input based on shift value.
  - Uses a custom-built function for both encoding and decoding logic.
  - Supports multiple rounds of user interaction using loops.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 8, I:
- Expanded my understanding of **Python functions** by learning how to accept and work with parameters.
- Discovered how using **keyword arguments** allows flexibility in function calling order.
- Designed a basic **encryption and decryption system** that mimics Caesar Cipher logic.
- Built a user-friendly, loop-based interface to repeatedly encrypt or decrypt messages.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Use `def function_name(parameter1, parameter2)` to pass inputs into functions.
- Keyword arguments allow function calls like `greet(name="Alice", location="Wonderland")`.
- The Caesar Cipher shifts letters by a set number of places in the alphabet.
- Simple loops, conditions, and indexing can build real-world logic like encoders/decoders.
