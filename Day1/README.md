# 📅 Day 1 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Printing output with `print()`
- Escape characters (`\n` for new lines)
- String concatenation using `+`
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Using variables to store input
- Measuring string length with `len()`
- Simple string-based project: Band Name Generator

## 📂 Files Included
- `string.py`: Basic `print()` statements and string concatenation examples.
- `input.py`: User input, variable usage, and measuring string length.
- `BandNameGenerator.py`: A fun project to create a band name from user inputs.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 1, I:
- Got comfortable using the `print()` function.
- Practiced how to concatenate strings and format output.
- Learned how to take input from the user and store it in variables.
- Used the `len()` function to calculate the length of a string.
- Built a fun mini-project: **Band Name Generator**, which combines user input creatively.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Python uses `+` for string concatenation.
- `input()` reads a string from the user.
- Variables store data temporarily for later use.
- The `len()` function returns the number of characters in a string.
