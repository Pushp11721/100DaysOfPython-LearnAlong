# 📅 Day 11 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Project-based learning: Building the **Blackjack** card game
- Creating reusable functions to generate cards and handle game logic
- Using the `random` module to simulate card draws
- Handling edge cases like the Ace card (`11` or `1`)
- Controlling game flow based on user input
- Visual enhancement using ASCII art from a separate file (`art.py`)

## 📂 Files Included
- `Blackjack.py`: A complete command-line version of the Blackjack game that includes:
  - Drawing cards for both the player and the computer
  - Score calculation and winner decision logic
  - Dynamic user interaction for drawing new cards or passing
- `art.py`: ASCII art logo used to display the Blackjack header.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 11, I:
- Designed and implemented a **Blackjack game simulator** using Python.
- Learned how to model deck behavior using lists and `random.choice()`.
- Managed complex conditions such as Ace card values and computer logic to stop drawing after reaching a threshold.
- Made the game interactive and visually appealing using ASCII art and structured code.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Functions are essential to modularize parts of the game like card dealing and scoring.
- Edge-case handling (like replacing Ace from 11 to 1) is critical for accurate game logic.
- Game loops and nested conditionals can be used to simulate real-time decision-based flow.
- Using `"\n"*50` or similar methods helps simulate screen clearing during gameplay.
