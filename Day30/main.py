#TODO : Handling Errors & Exceptions

#FileNotFoundError
# with open("a_file.txt") as file:
#     file.read()

#KeyError
# a_dictionary = {"key":"value"}
# value = a_dictionary["non_existent_key"]

#IndexError
# fruit_list = ["Apple","Banana","Pear"]
# fruit = fruit_list[3]

#TypeError
# text = "abc"
# print(text + 5)

#How we will control error
#try: Something that might cause an exception
#except: Do this if there was an exception
#else: Do this if there were NO EXCEPTION
#finally: Do this NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
