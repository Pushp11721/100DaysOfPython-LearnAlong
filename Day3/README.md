# 📅 Day 3 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `elif`
- Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- Using the modulo `%` operator to determine even or odd
- Nesting conditions inside other conditions
- Logical flow and user input handling
- Mini-projects using conditionals and branching logic

## 📂 Files Included
- `IfElse.py`: Basic use of `if-else` statements for height checking.
- `Modulo.py`: Using `%` to determine even or odd numbers.
- `Nesting.py`: Multi-layered condition checks for age-based ticket pricing and optional features.
- `Pizza.py`: Simulates a pizza ordering system with size and topping options.
- `Project_TreasureIsland.py`: A fun, text-based adventure game using nested conditions and decision-making.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 3, I:
- Learned the core concepts of **decision-making** in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- Practiced writing **nested conditional logic** to build more interactive and real-world flows.
- Understood how to use the **modulo operator** for number classification (even/odd).
- Built multiple small programs and a larger **game-like project** to apply conditional logic in a creative and engaging way.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Comparison operators are essential for checking conditions and triggering decisions.
- Conditions can be **nested** to allow multi-layered logic.
- The `%` operator is useful for evaluating remainders, which helps in even/odd checks.
- Good user input handling and validation improve user experience in interactive programs.
- Writing text-based games helps visualize the flow of logic and build problem-solving skills.
