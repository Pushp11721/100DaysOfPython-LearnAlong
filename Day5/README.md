# 📅 Day 5 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Looping through lists using `for` loops
- Manual implementation of `sum()` and `max()` functions
- The `range()` function and step values
- FizzBuzz problem-solving pattern
- Random password generation using characters, numbers, and symbols

## 📂 Files Included
- `list.py`: Iterating over a list using a `for` loop and modifying elements in-place.
- `sum_max.py`: Calculating total and maximum values in a list both manually and using built-in functions.
- `range.py`: Using `range()` with and without step size to generate sequences and sums.
- `FizzBuzz.py`: Classic programming exercise for conditional logic and modular arithmetic.
- `PyPassword.py`: A random password generator using user input and randomization of characters.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 5, I:
- Practiced **looping through lists** using `for` loops.
- Recreated the behavior of Python’s built-in `sum()` and `max()` functions to understand how they work under the hood.
- Learned how `range()` can be used to iterate over a sequence of numbers with optional step sizes.
- Solved the **FizzBuzz** problem, which tests logic for divisibility and condition handling.
- Built a full-featured **password generator** using lists, random choices, and the `shuffle()` function to improve password randomness.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- `for` loops are ideal for iterating over lists and ranges.
- Built-in functions like `sum()` and `max()` simplify common tasks but are easy to implement manually.
- `range(a, b, c)` includes `a` but not `b`, and `c` is the step size.
- Conditional branching (`if`, `elif`, `else`) is critical for logic-heavy programs like FizzBuzz.
- Combining `random.choice()`, `shuffle()`, and `join()` can create powerful tools like password generators.
