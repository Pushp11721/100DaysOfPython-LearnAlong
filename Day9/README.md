# 📅 Day 9 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Creating and using Python **dictionaries**
- Accessing dictionary values using keys
- Creating **empty dictionaries** and wiping existing ones
- Looping through dictionary keys
- Nesting:
  - Lists inside dictionaries
  - Dictionaries inside lists
  - Dictionaries inside dictionaries
- Writing custom logic for a real-world scenario using a dictionary

## 📂 Files Included
- `dict1.py`: Introduction to Python dictionaries, how to create, access, and loop through them.
- `Dict&List.py`: Demonstrates various levels of **nesting**, such as lists inside dictionaries and dictionaries within dictionaries.
- `auction.py`: A **Secret Auction Program** where:
  - Users input their names and bids.
  - The highest bidder(s) are determined.
  - Results are displayed cleanly, even for tied bids.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 9, I:
- Explored **dictionaries** and how they differ from lists by using key-value pairs.
- Practiced **nesting data structures** to model more complex, real-life scenarios (like travel logs).
- Created a fully functional **Secret Auction** app that accepts dynamic input and determines the winner programmatically.
- Improved my understanding of how to loop through dictionaries and perform value-based operations.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Use `dictionary[key]` to access values, and `for key in dictionary:` to loop through keys.
- Nesting allows multi-level data representation that mimics real-world data models.
- Functions help modularize the code (like separating data collection, winner calculation, and result display).
- Clearing screen output can simulate a new turn (`print("\n"*100)` in this case).
