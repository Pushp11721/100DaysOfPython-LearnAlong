# 📅 Day 6 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Defining and calling functions in Python
- Understanding function structure: `def`, indentation, and execution flow

## 📂 Files Included
- `function.py`: A basic example of defining and executing a user-defined function.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 6, I:
- Learned how to create a simple **function** in Python using the `def` keyword.
- Understood the importance of **indentation** in defining function bodies.
- Practiced calling the function to see its output multiple times.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Functions are reusable blocks of code that help organize logic and reduce repetition.
- Use `def function_name():` to define a function.
- Indented code under the function runs only when the function is called.
- Functions improve modularity and readability of code.
