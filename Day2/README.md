# 📅 Day 2 - Python Learning Log

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Subscripting strings (indexing with positive & negative values)
- Python data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`
- Using `type()` to check data types
- `len()` to find string length
- Type conversion using `str()` and `int()`
- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`
- Order of operations (PEMDAS)
- BMI calculation using expressions and type casting
- Rounding numbers with `round()`
- Using `f-strings` for cleaner output formatting
- Simple project: Tip Calculator

## 📂 Files Included
- `DataTypes&Operations.py`: Practice with data types, operations, type checking, and string subscripting.
- `NumManipulation.py`: Working with expressions, rounding, number manipulation, and `f-string` formatting.
- `TipCalculator.py`: Mini-project to calculate how much each person should pay including tip.

## 📝 Summary
On Day 2, I:
- Explored different **data types** in Python and learned how to identify them.
- Practiced **subscripting** to access individual characters in strings.
- Learned about **type conversion** to avoid type mismatch errors.
- Understood how **arithmetic operations** work in Python and how operator precedence (PEMDAS) affects results.
- Implemented a **BMI calculator**(in `NumManipulation.py`) and a **Tip Calculator** using user input and proper formatting.

## 🚀 Key Learnings
- Use `type()` to check a variable’s data type.
- Always convert non-string data to `str()` when concatenating with strings.
- `//` returns floor division (an integer), and `**` performs exponentiation.
- Use `round(number, digits)` to control decimal places.
- `f-strings` make it easier to embed variables into strings cleanly.
